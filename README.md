# How It Works
1. User Authentication
   - First time users create a master password, which is hashed and stored.
   - On launch, the user must enter the correct master password to unlock the vault.
2. Password Storage
   - Credentials (website, username, password) are encrypted and saved to a local file.
   - The file is unreadable without the correct master key.
3. Password Encryption
   - Uses AES symmetric encryption with a securely generated key derived from the master password
   - Stored passwords are decrypted only after successful authentication
4. Password Generator
   - User can generate strong, random password based on customized rules.
5. Auto Clear Clipboard
   - Passwords copied to clipboard are automatically cleared after a short duration to reduce risk
